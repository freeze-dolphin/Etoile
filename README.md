# Ã‰toile

A mini tool written in C that helps convert `.arcpkg` to Arcaea readable `songlist`

## Problem

This program is under very early stage, and you may encounter bugs

## Usage

### Summary

If there is any error threw during the conversion, the program refuses to generate `songlist`

Errors will be printed directly into `stderr`

So no matter whether the conversion is successful or not, please check `etoile.log` and try to fix Warnings before importing to `Arcaea`

### Command-line arguments

| args        | desc         | example                         |
|:------------|:-------------|:--------------------------------|
| --input, -i | .arcpkg file | -i ./Pilcrow_.LivingWill.arcpkg |
| --songs, -o | songs dir    | -o ./songs                      |
| --bg, -b    | bg dir       | -b assets/img/bg                |
| --pack, -p  | pack name    | -p default                      |

| options        | desc                            |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------|
| --force        | enable force mode [^1]          |
| --fix-constant | enable auto constant fixer [^2] |
| --help, -h     | show the help message           |

[^1]: After enabling force mode, the program will disable prompts when overwriting `songlist` and background images
[^2]: Some charts are packed without a specific chart constant but a sting like "Future 10", we cannot detect the proper constant from this
since some charters may fill "Eternity 12" and so on into it... By enabling this option, the program will use 1.0 as chart constant for them

### Lua

As for aff processing system, it uses Lua as script

You **MUST** define a function named `exec`, with one argument which will receive the whole chart aff

**Please notice that everything is define in the TOP LEVEL**

## Building

## Roadmap & Plans

Plans are divided into different parts according to their stages of execution in the program.

### Prelude

Before we actually start the conversion...

- [ ] selective extraction:

  Only the song(s) of selected id(s) will be extracted and others will be ignored
  Using the following launch args, Etoile will only extract `ShiMei.SimpleFolds` and  `Arcthesia.Unplayable`

    ```shell
    $ ./Etoile \
    --select "ShiMei.SimpleFolds;Arcthesia.Unplayable" \
    -i ./arcpkg/ACC5.Standard.arcpkg \
    -o ./songs \
    -b ./img/bg/1080 \
    -p default \
    --force
    ```

### In-Operation

During the conversion

#### Resources & Structure

- [x] Auto extract chart resources
- [ ] Log warn while processing charts with scene-control
- [ ] [TODO 1] If PST, PRS and BYD use the same audio / jacket, they should use 'base' as audio / jacket (currently, the program will
  copy `base.ogg` / `base.jpg` and rename it to `0.ogg` etc. if there is PST chart)

#### Chart

- [x] Custom Lua script support for aff preprocessing
- [ ] Optimize Lua processing, split the single Lua script into Prelude (define basic func etc.) and Core (where our `exec` func locates),
  so that we don't need to define util-functions for every aff
- [ ] Ask for user's response when encountering undetectable chart difficulty
- [ ] [TODO 2] or we could make a converter for those charts without a chart constant, which converts "Future 10" to chart constant 10.0

### Outputting

The output of the conversion, the `songlist` in short

- [ ] settings overwriting: (I didn't realize how complicated the structure of `songlist` is until I looked up 'PRAGMATISM'...)

    ```json
    {
      "ratingClass": 3,
      "title_localized": {
        "en": "PRAGMATISM -RESURRECTION-"
      },
      "audioOverride": true,
      "chartDesigner": "THE LAST DREAM",
      "jacketDesigner": "ã‚·ã‚¨ãƒ©",
      "jacketOverride": true,
      "bg": "pragmatism3",
      "rating": 11,
      "date": 1639008004,
      "version": "3.10"
    } 
    ```
